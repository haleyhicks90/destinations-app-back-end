# Destinations App

This is the link to the Heroku App (https://protected-anchorage-72121.herokuapp.com/).

## Technologies Used

This is a MERN Full Stack Application using the following technologies:
    * Node.js
    * Mongoose
    * Express
    * React
    * HTML
    * CSS

### Approach Taken

    * Using the MVC (Models, Views, Controllers) file structure, there is one model with full CRUD functionality.
    * A user is able to view several popular destinations. They are also able to add new destinations, edit existing destinations, and delete a destination.

### Unsolved Problems

    * User authentication and login is set up, but a user is not able to create an account through the browser. Everything is working properly in the back-end, but there are some issues to authentication in the front-end.

### Future Add-ons

    * After fixing authentication, another great functionality could be implementing sessions.
    * Using sessions, a user could be able to add destinations to their favorites.
